\section{Introduction}

The project is officially called (italian) \textit{Sviluppo e sperimentazione di metodologie di controllo per droni} and it lies in the field of agricultural robots. The aim of these months will be the implementation of a real drone which is able to move in a area and take informations autonomously through some device mounted on the robot (thermal imager). The project can be splitted in two main parallel directions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Navigation (path planner, control schemes, etc.)
	\item Implementation (drone construction, autopilot selection, etc.)
\end{itemize}
